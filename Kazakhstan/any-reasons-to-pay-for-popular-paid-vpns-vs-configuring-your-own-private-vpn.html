    <tr><td>skatuka</td><td><p>When the Internet was blocked in Kazakhstan popular VPNs got blocked.<br>
Is there any reason to pay for them?<br>

<p>If you have the technical ability, a self-made VPN has the potential to be more resistant to blocking. There are a few reasons for this. One is that if only a few people use it, the IP address is less conspicuous. Another is that commercial VPNs are not always designed for circumvention, and therefore may not use covert protocols.</p>

<p>Proper major VPN providers use customized obfuscated protocols and setup special servers for filtered regions like Kazakstan.</p>

<p>If your government detect and block VPN/proxies by protocols, there are probably aren’t. If not (if it just block VPN providers’ IP addresses/servers, not the protocols) then you can setup your own private VPN/proxy server.</p></td><td>2022-04-20T03:49:03.087Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><p>Are you talking about during the <a href="https://ntc.party/t/network-shutdown-all-around-kazakhstan/1601">shutdown from January 5 to January 11</a>? I thought that it was almost everything blocked at that time, nothing targeted towards VPNs specifically. In that situation, a homemade VPN and a commercial VPN will be equally ineffective. There were only a few things that worked at that time, but none of them is part of any common VPN protocol: <a href="https://ntc.party/t/topic/1686" class="inline-onebox">Уроки, вынесенные из отключения интернета в Казахстане в январе 2022 года для обхода цензуры</a>.</p></td><td>2022-04-21T22:10:43.219Z</td></tr>
