I'm the administrator of free censorship circumvention service with 400 000+ active users, and nyaa.si returns 429 Too Many Requests for most of server IP addresses. Is it possible to do something about that?
[07:01] &lt;valdikss&gt; https://antizapret.prostovpn.org/do-not-block-this-proxy/
[08:11] &lt;Iona|I-401&gt; valdikss, If it's blocked it was because of abuse and likely won't change
[08:17] &lt;valdikss&gt; Iona|I-401: well, it returns "too many requests".
[08:19] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; There's really nothing we can do about it if you you have hundreds of users behind a single IP
[08:19] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; All it takes is a couple to spam the site with requests to get automatically blocked
[08:20] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; Even if we unblock it this time it'll happen again
[08:23] &lt;valdikss&gt; You may consider adding it into whitelists. I have 7 proxy servers and 2 VPN servers, each with different IP (v4/v6) address.
[08:25] &lt;valdikss&gt; If there's some kind of abuse going on, please tell me, I'll see what I can do.
[08:25] &lt;valdikss&gt; Suzukaze: ^^^
[08:27] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; There's no whitelist, the limitation is automated and based only on the IP and requests sent in certain amounts of time
[08:29] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; It's not something average users will have happen, so no whitelist exists because anything that hits the limits should be blocked 
[09:28] &lt;Suzukaze&gt; valdikss there's nothing I can do, you'll need to figure it out yourself or tell people to use a non-shared proxy
