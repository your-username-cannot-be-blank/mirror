    <tr><td>antid0pe(Antid0pe)</td><td><p>Hi, first of all sorry about my grammar, I am just a Turkish guy that wants to surf on internet freely. My ISP is Superonline, I was using <a href="https://github.com/LGA1150/netfilter-spooftcp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">netfilter-spooftcp</a> I know it is not a <em>software</em> but at the end of the day it was working. Well, I do not know why but it stopped working but yeah it stopped working so that’s why I decided to switch zapret over it and it was working either, eventually sadly it stopped working, too. I still can use PowerTunnel on my android phone without any error, issue whatever you call but in desktop I have no choice. So if you are a linux user what do you use to get rid of dpi.<br>
Thanks and again, sorry for my bad grammar.</p></td><td>2021-05-27T23:43:51.899Z</td></tr><tr><td>antid0pe(Antid0pe)</td><td><p>I could make PowerTunnel work, lets go!</p></td><td>2021-05-28T23:30:23.554Z</td></tr><tr><td>ValdikSS</td><td><p>zapret has different modes of operation, have you tried them all?<br>
As far as I can see, zapret is the most mature and functional among all alternatives.</p></td><td>2021-06-02T07:41:23.456Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><p>On Linux you can use Tor Browser. It is not as fast as other circumvention systems, and it does not automatically tunnel all traffic like a VPN would, but it is usually reliable for evading blocking and is a good thing to have in reserve.</p>
<p>You can download from <a href="https://www.torproject.org/tr/download/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.torproject.org/tr/download/</a> (Turkish localization).</p>
<ul>
<li>If the download is blocked, you can try a mirror: <a href="https://tor.eff.org/tr/download/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1</a> <a href="https://tor.calyxinstitute.org/tr/download/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">2</a> <a href="https://tor.ccc.de/tr/download" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3</a>.</li>
<li>Or you can send an email to <a href="mailto:gettor@torproject.org">gettor@torproject.org</a> with “linux” in the email body.</li>
<li>Or download from <a href="https://archive.org/details/@gettor" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://archive.org/details/@gettor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time you run it, you have to <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/tr/circumvention/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">configure the browser for circumvention</a>. Select “Configure” (“Yapılandır”) then “Tor is censored in my country” (“Bulunduğum ülkede Tor ağı engelleniyor”). Then select obfs4 or meek-azure.</p>
<p>For better evasion using obfs4, you can use a <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/tr/bridges/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">non-public bridge</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click “Request a Bridge…” (“Köprü isteğinde bulun…”) and solve the captcha.</li>
<li>Or go to <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/?lang=tr" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BridgeDB</a> and request obfs4 bridges. You can save the bridges in a file to use later if you find yourself blocked.</li>
