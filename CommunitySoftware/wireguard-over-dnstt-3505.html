    <tr><td>PartyRock</td><td><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Is it possible to make DNSTT support UDP as well?  I am trying to build the following so my mobile phone can bypass firewall restrictions.  However, Wireguard only runs on UDP.</p>
<p>Wireguard client &lt;—&gt; DNSTT client &lt;—&gt; DNSTT server &lt;—&gt; Wireguard server</p>
<p>I am very new to this and sorry if I asked a n00b question.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></td><td>2022-11-24T18:32:37.770Z</td></tr><tr><td>bolvan</td><td><p>Why do you want wireguard ? Openvpn can operate over TCP.<br>
Openvpn is available on any platform</p></td><td>2022-11-24T19:55:44.769Z</td></tr><tr><td>PartyRock</td><td><p>I’ll give openvpn a try.  Thanks!</p></td><td>2022-11-24T21:25:13.533Z</td></tr><tr><td>PartyRock</td><td><p>I have not gotten Openvpn to work yet but I do have another question.</p>
<p>In my region, Internet access might not be the most stable and there could be network disconnection.  Is there a way to make dnstt-client auto reconnect when that happens?  When there is a disconnect, the ncat client can no longer get through to the server side unless I restart the dnstt-client.</p></td><td>2022-11-25T16:20:48.083Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><p>dnstt itself is built on the assumption of provide a reliable stream interface to user-space applications.</p>
<p>You can think of dnstt as a combination of two things: a specific way of encoding chunks of data into DNS <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/protocol.html#query">queries</a> and <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/protocol.html#response">responses</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/protocol.html#overview">KCP/smux session and reliability layer</a>. The KCP/smux layer is the “tt” (turbo tunnel) part of the name.</p>
<p>If you want to use DNS like a VPN (kernel space not user space), you don’t need the session and reliability part. That’s because the kernel already has its own mechanisms for sessions and reliability. You only need a way to encode IP datagrams as DNS queries/responses.</p>
<p>The software doesn’t support it at this point, but conceptually would be possible to use <a href="https://repo.or.cz/dnstt.git/blob/81b502c735882c74a32ec9acebd3dbe21f30f092:/dnstt-client/dns.go#l99">dnstt’s encodings</a> on raw IP datagrams, and remove the KCP/smux layer to get a VPN-like interface that works with WireGuard and UDP. You would need a virtual network interface with the MTU set small enough (around 120 bytes) to fit into a DNS query. This is how <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/survey.html#TUNS">TUNS</a> works, for example.</p>
<p>One option for you to try is <a href="https://github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks">tun2socks</a>. You can set dnstt up to be a SOCKS proxy; then tun2socks can provide a network interface over the top of it.</p>
<p>It is likely also possible to implement a DNS encoding specifically for WireGuard. Here are some examples of how obfuscations have been implemented for WireGuard specifically:</p>

<p>I see what you’re saying. I don’t think there’s an automatic way to do this now. I’m planning a change (after <a href="https://ntc.party/t/do-not-send-data-when-there-are-no-clients/2213">this thread</a>) that might make the situation better. It will have the side effect of starting a new session if all connected clients have disconnected.</p>
