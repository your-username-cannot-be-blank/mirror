Unlike other anti-censorship tools, ReQrypt does not rely on a network of friendly two-way proxy severs, but instead uses outbound-only special server.

<p>Unlike other anti-censorship tools, ReQrypt does <strong>not</strong> rely on a network of friendly proxy severs. Instead, ReQrypt works more like a user-controllable <em>routing tool</em> , that lets the user redirecting outbound packets through one or more encrypted tunnel(s) – bypassing the local adversary. ReQrypt does not affect inbound traffic, which is sent via the normal route.</p>
<p>ReQrypt has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since ReQrypt does not rely on proxy servers, <strong>your IP address will not be changed</strong> . To the remote web server, it appears as though your traffic was sent directly from your PC unchanged (save for TTL values and fragmentation).</li>
<li>Since inbound packets are sent directly from the web server to your browser, and not via a proxy server, ReQrypt is <strong>fast</strong> .</li>
<li>(For tunnel operators): running a ReQrypt server is <strong>cheaper</strong> than running a proxy server, since outbound traffic (web requests) is usually much smaller than inbound traffic (web responses).</li>
</ul>
<p>ReQrypt is effective against most lightweight filtering/logging systems that are popular in western countries, since such systems usually only intercept outbound traffic. Intercepting inbound traffic is generally more expensive and technically challenging, thus is usually ignored.</p></td><td>2019-09-25T06:35:30.605Z</td></tr><tr><td>ValdikSS</td><td></td><td>2021-09-13T10:22:15.170Z</td></tr>
