    <tr><td>psychobacter</td><td><p>Initially, I selected “transparent” in proxy mode and enabled system-wide proxy settings. Unfortunately, this setup didn’t seem to work as expected. When I tested it using dnsleaktest, the DOH server I specified in the settings didn’t appear in the results. Instead, only my ISP’s DNS server showed up. DPI bypass only works when I use HTTP proxy mode.</p>
<p>In another attempt, I ran the app in transparent mode while also enabling Android’s native encrypted DNS option. This time, there were no DNS leaks according to the dnsleak test. However, DPI bypass was not successful and my ISP continued to block certain websites.</p></td><td>2024-02-08T11:37:43.652Z</td></tr>
