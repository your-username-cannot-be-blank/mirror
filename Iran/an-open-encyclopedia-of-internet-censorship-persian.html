<p>What is your vision of how this encyclopedia will be used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fundamental problem is that in some countries, especially Iran, sometimes even experts do not know about censorship techniques. They do not know the difference between being blocked by an ISP or the infrastructure and being sanctioned by the websites themselves.<br>
As a result, all their thoughts and efforts will be in the dark. They do not know who is responsible for the problem to protest against them or how to circumvent that censorship.<br>
Therefore, if we can raise the level of collective awareness, we can both better and more documentedly fight extremists and build tools that are more effective in countering censorship. Also, removing one or more people by governments will not change anything in this struggle for freedom.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As I explained, both, and document censorship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like the plan to include discussion of throttling and outages caused by sanctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think there was or will be an outage due to sanctions*. But I heard rumors that for some unknown reason, Iran does not peer with AWS. I don’t know if it is because of sanctions or some kind of throttling by the government.<br>
However, if there is a case, I will look forward to it. (After documenting the censorship techniques that occur in Iran and the Iranian and international community is still unaware of it.)</p>
<p>[*] If you refer to NIAC reporters. They are known as supporters of the Islamic Republic in the United States. In a situation where the people are oppressed by the government, they turn all their attention to trivial issues. E.g., at a time when the Islamic Republic was massacring people after the complete Internet shutdown, they blamed the United States and sanctions. This led many who did not know NIAC to think that the United States had cut off the Internet, not the Islamic Republic. (Because of this, I have often heard this misconception from activists in this field)</p></td><td>2021-09-08T10:56:50.176Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><aside class="quote no-group quote-modified" data-username="xhdix" data-post="3" data-topic="1223">

<p>Even Google does not know exactly. But they collect a lot of data and have their own database to geolocate users and IPs. (As I heard.)</p>
<p>There are many Android devices whose data is sent to Google. All our activities and the disconnection and reconnection of our VPNs are sent to Google servers or to servers that are directly monitored by Google. History of our use of Google Maps or our searches and our language, time zone, our personal characteristics and the people we interact with, the name of the mobile network, etc. alone can be enough for Google’s AI to decide and make changes to its database.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no settings that tell Google not to track me in any way or to receive this particular data from a mobile phone. And of course, not all users can be warned to disable the available options in their account privacy settings.</p>
