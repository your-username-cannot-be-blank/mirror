They do not know the difference between being blocked by an ISP or the infrastructure and being sanctioned by the websites themselves.<br>\nAs a result, all their thoughts and efforts will be in the dark. They do not know who is responsible for the problem to protest against them or how to circumvent that censorship.<br>\nTherefore, if we can raise the level of collective awareness, we can both better and more documentedly fight extremists and build tools that are more effective in countering censorship. Also, removing one or more people by governments will not change anything in this struggle for freedom.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it a guide for people who experience censorship, to help them get around it? Is it technical information for people who are not experiencing censorship but can help measure it or build tools?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I explained, both, and document censorship.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like the plan to include discussion of throttling and outages caused by sanctions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not think there was or will be an outage due to sanctions*. But I heard rumors that for some unknown reason, Iran does not peer with AWS. I don’t know if it is because of sanctions or some kind of throttling by the government.<br>\nHowever, if there is a case, I will look forward to it. (After documenting the censorship techniques that occur in Iran and the Iranian and international community is still unaware of it.)</p>\n<p>[*] If you refer to NIAC reporters. They are known as supporters of the Islamic Republic in the United States. In a situation where the people are oppressed by the government, they turn all their attention to trivial issues. E.g., at a time when the Islamic Republic was massacring people after the complete Internet shutdown, they blamed the United States and sanctions. This led many who did not know NIAC to think that the United States had cut off the Internet, not the Islamic Republic. (Because of this, I have often heard this misconception from activists in this field)</p>",
