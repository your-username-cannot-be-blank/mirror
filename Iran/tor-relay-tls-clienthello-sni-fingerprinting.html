<p>You can connect to the majority of Tor relays, but the connection would freeze if this type of SNI is used along with ClientHello size &lt;= 256 bytes.<br>
Changing the domain name even slightly, like <code>.com</code> to <code>.org</code> allows to connect to Tor Relay.<br>
This filter seem to be applied only to known Relays IP addresses in Tor network.</p></td><td>2023-03-03T10:38:13.192Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><p>I thought that the client SNI encoded some signification information for the Tor handshake, but I was mistaken. By my reading of the spec, there are no restrictions on the SNI, and so the name generation algorithm could be changed by a single client compatibly.</p>
<p>What I was thinking of, relating to the name being significant, is actually in the server certificate. A commonName ending in <code>.net</code> indicates a v2 handshake; any other TLD is for a v3 handshake. For backward compatibility, some conventional implementation details of the v2 handshake were selected to be markers of v2 when v3 was introduced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In “in-protocol” (a.k.a. “the v3 handshake”), the initiator sends no certificates, and the responder sends a single connection certificate.  The choice of ciphersuites must be as in a “renegotiation” handshake.  There are additionally a set of constraints on the connection certificate, which the initiator can use to learn that the in-protocol handshake is in use.  Specifically, at least one of these properties must be true of the certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The certificate is self-signed</li>
<li>Some component other than “commonName” is set in the subject or issuer DN of the certificate.</li>
<li>The commonName of the subject or issuer of the certificate ends with a suffix other than “.net”.</li>
<li>The certificate’s public key modulus is longer than 1024 bits.</li>
</ul>
