    <tr><td>fortuna</td><td><p>The Geneva team has reported on a new protocol whitelister that has been deployed in Iran: <a href="https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/posts/iran-whitelister/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/posts/iran-whitelister/</a></p>
<p>Here are my observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>They observe traffic to ports 53, 80 and 443 and block connections that are not DNS, HTTP or HTTPS.</li>
<li>They monitor the first two packets only</li>
<li>They are not able to reassemble the TCP connection. Sending “G”, “ET”, “/” for HTTP fails when “GET /” succeeds.</li>
<li>Blocking happens by blocking the second and subsequent packets from the client.
<ul>
<li>This aligns with pcaps I’ve seen for blocked Outline servers in Iran. The client is able to send some data, but the rest is blackholed and it looks like a client timeout from the server perspective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Server packets are not affected</li>
<li>DNS-over-TCP is blocked, but usually there’s no second packet, so there’s not much disruption there.</li>
<li>The whitelister is not bidirectional. You need to be in Iran to trigger it</li>
<li>Not all destination IPs are subject to the whitelister. It’s unclear what IP ranges are affected.</li>
<li>Their Geneva system learned some circumvention strategies:
<ul>
<li>Send two empty FIN packets before the TCP handshake. You can’t implement this on mobile and it’s very fingerprintable.</li>
<li>Send 9 ACKs during the TCP handshake. Also fingerprintable and not mobile-friendly.</li>
<li>Send a HTTP GET fingerprint with corrupted checksum before each packet. Mobile apps could prepend traffic with a GET, but not tamper with the checksum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></td><td>2020-08-06T17:29:46.855Z</td></tr><tr><td>fortuna</td><td><p>One question I have: can you establish a connection, wait some time, then use it freely?<br>
Depending on how long you need to wait, a circumvention tool could leverage a pool of connections that are set up before they are needed.</p></td><td>2020-08-06T17:31:40.387Z</td></tr>
