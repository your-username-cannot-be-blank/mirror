    <tr><td>ValdikSS</td><td><p>If you were actively using internet in the end of 90s/beginning of 00s, you may remember websites with tildes in the URL, like this one:<br>
<code>https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</code></p>
<p>This is a Putty software page, hosted on <code>chiark.greenend.org.uk</code> shared hosting by <code>sgtatham</code> account.</p>
<p>That setup was fairly common in that days shared hostings, due to web server configuration simplicity: tilde in Unix means the home directory of the user that goes after tilde. In the URL above, <code>~sgtatham</code> refers to <code>sgtatham</code> user home directory path. All shared hosting needed to do is to create new user, which will automatically result in shell and/or FTP access and web hosting access, no additional configuration needed.</p>
<p>You can try tilde on your Linux box: <code>cd ~root</code> is an equivalent for <code>cd /root</code>; <code>cd ~mysql</code> will do <code>cd /var/lib/mysql</code>.</p>
<p>If you were interested in Linux, VPS or web hosting that days, you may remember free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_account" rel="nofollow noopener">shell account</a> offers, which gave you non-root SSH access to Linux or FreeBSD box, to learn the OS, its commands and software.</p>
<p>Nowadays, these two ideas reincarnated under the <strong>tilde</strong> name, which usually means Linux shell account access and a web hosting under your /~username.</p>
<p>Tilde is not a type of an access or something, it’s just the name of original server tilde.club, created by Paul Ford in 2014. Read <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf" rel="nofollow noopener">the story of its creation</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you want Linux shell account and a web hosting for free, here are some tildes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://tilde.club/" rel="nofollow noopener">tilde.club</a> — the original tilde server. Had signups closed for a long time, now accepts new users.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://tilde.team/" rel="nofollow noopener">tilde.team</a> — has great <a href="https://tilde.team/wiki/" rel="nofollow noopener">wiki</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://hashbang.sh/" rel="nofollow noopener">hashbang.sh</a> — this one has very extensive <a href="https://github.com/hashbang/shell-server/tree/master/ansible/tasks" rel="nofollow noopener">server hardening ansible configuration paybooks</a> on their github, very useful information for configuring shared shell access on your own server.</li>
<li><a href="http://tilde.town/" rel="nofollow noopener">tilde.town</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tilde.black/" rel="nofollow noopener">tilde.black</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ctrl-c.club/" rel="nofollow noopener">ctrl-c.club</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tildecow.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">tildecow.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tilde.institute/" rel="nofollow noopener">tilde.institute</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackers.cool/" rel="nofollow noopener">hackers.cool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some servers apply rather limiting configuration on number of background processes, memory and CPU consumption, some are pretty lax.</p>
<p>Tilde is not only about technologies, it’s also about community: many Tilde servers are joined into one large <a href="https://tildeverse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Tildeverse</a>, with their IRC chat, wikis, educational information, blogging and microblogging services, etc.</p>
<p>Wikis on Tildas are the storehouse of useful information. Check <a href="https://tilde.team/wiki/cli-for-beginners" rel="nofollow noopener">Command Line Shell, for Absolute Beginners</a> article on tilde.team, it’s the link I give to people with no experience with the shell, and they ask me no questions after it.</p></td><td>2019-10-01T01:17:53.312Z</td></tr><tr><td>ValdikSS</td><td><p>All Tilde servers have internet connectivity. You can use them as a proxy servers to circumvent censorship, but please do not abuse the link as all the servers are run by the volunteers and are not intended to be used for torrenting etc.</p>
<p>The simpliest setup is Socks5 server using OpenSSH: <code>ssh -D 1080 servername.example.com</code></p>
<p>In Russia, you can use it with <a href="https://ntc.party/c/community-software/runet-censorship-bypass-extension">Runet Censorship Bypass</a> browser extension by <a class="mention" href="/u/ilyaigpetrov">@ilyaigpetrov</a>, it has support for Socks5 proxies.</p></td><td>2019-10-01T01:19:07.085Z</td></tr>
