I from Belarus, my IPS is A1 mobile operator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_Belarus" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">A1 Belarus - Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>I use Internet provided by my mobile operator, it has speed 50 mbps. My IPS blocks torrent protocol as I understand. I can freely use Internet on full speed and download what ever I want by http / https. But when I try to download torrent file (not a torrent with meta information but target files itself) then downloading just not starting at all. My provider do not block torrent sites, only torrent files downloading.</p>
<p>I use torrent client on my laptop and my phone as a USB router / modem. I bypass traffic routing for “USB teathering” and “Wi-Fi hotspot” by changing TTL, no problems here.</p>
<p>I tried VPN / proxy and it helps. But I wonder if it is possible to bypass the blocking without VPN.</p>
<p>Articles that I found say that it is very hard for IPS to recognize if connection is torrent specific to block it. So It is interesting to know how they block torrent traffic.<br>
I have to notice that when torrent traffic is blocked it is possible to download something by http protocol at the same time. I mean it is not just “block everything if there is something suspicious”.</p>
<p>What I tried and it did not help:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use 80 port with disabled UPnP / NAT-PMP option</li>
<li>I use required encryption</li>
<li>I set up quantity of connection to lower values (8, 16, 32). I tried with lower and with high, no difference here.</li>
<li>I tried anonymous mode in qbittorrent client</li>
<li>I tried to disable DHT, PeX, Local Peer Discovery to be more anonymous.</li>
<li>I tried to use VPN without “use proxy for peer connections” and in the case event if I use proxy there is no downloading at all. I can download only with enabled “use proxy for peer connections” option.</li>
</ol>

This may help in some cases.</p></td><td>2021-11-02T08:37:11.626Z</td></tr><tr><td>viyemew229(viyemew229)</td><td><p>Hi, I am <a class="mention" href="/u/xalen56663">@xalen56663</a> it is new account cause I lost my password.</p>

<p><strong>FYYI</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>uTP disabling did not help, I tried that with all previous options of course</li>
<li>Torrent downloading is working for A1 ISP when I use WebRTC torrent client like WebTorrent <a href="https://webtorrent.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://webtorrent.io/</a> for example. Problem here is that amount of torrent clients that support WebRTC is small. For example when I downloaded file with more than 1000 seeds only two of them uploaded the file by WebRTC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also qbittorent do not support WebRTC yet <a href="https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/4163" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WebTorrent support · Issue #4163 · qbittorrent/qBittorrent · GitHub</a><br>
But as I understood there is some code already but not in main released version.<br>
Vuze torrent client supports WebRTC.</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GoodbyeDPI</a> did not help or I do something wrong. I tried almost all <strong>bat</strong> files inside its folder. Additional I used DNSCrypt and also I tried wihout DNSCrypt.</p>
<p>As a result. Only working solution now is a proxy or VPN.</p></td><td>2021-11-17T08:41:31.944Z</td></tr><tr><td>cypherpunks(cypherpunks:writecodes)</td><td><p>Your damned ISP is evil.</p>
