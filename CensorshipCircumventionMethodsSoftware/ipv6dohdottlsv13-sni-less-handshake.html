    <tr><td>critical_error</td><td><p>It makes any snooping on our network connections more complicated, isn’t it?<br>
Enumerating/blacklisting the IPv6 address space is hard. IPv6 allows us to get as many addresses as needed, so SNI extensions turn useless. DOT/DOH and a TLS handshake encrypted since the first message do the rest. What caveats might appear?<br>
Willing to block SNI-less connections are already doing this. Those, who chose not to adopt IPv6, will remain restricted to IPv4 for ten years or so. I suppose, decisions have been made. No ‘forensic’ will be surprised or scared :).</p></td><td>2021-10-22T18:48:13.186Z</td></tr><tr><td>tango</td><td><p>There are a few caveats and details I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>One difficulty is <a href="https://censorbib.nymity.ch/#Frolov2019a">TLS fingerprinting</a>. Even with encryption, the fingerprint of the TLS handshake can identify the connection as being from circumvention software. See for example <a href="https://ooni.org/post/making-ooni-probe-android-more-resilient/#changing-our-android-tls-fingerprint">OONI’s recent trouble</a> with the Go net/tls fingerprint on certain hardware configurations. TLS fingerprinting is not impossible to overcome, but it needs some effort.</li>
<li>The censor can identify proxies using <a href="https://censorbib.nymity.ch/#Ensafi2015b">active probing</a> unless there is some form of client authentication.</li>
<li>If a proxy will only be used by one or a few users, it’s not a problem, but for a proxy shared with many people, you need a way to distribute the proxy’s network address (and possible client authentication) to real users without the censor also learning the address.</li>
</ol></td><td>2021-10-25T03:29:20.633Z</td></tr><tr><td>critical_error</td><td><p>First of all, my proposal is not about current Internet censorship champions like China or Turkmenistan. Quite probably, both China and Turkmenistan are already blocking the SNI-less TLS connections. The former is known by blocking just all fast DOH/DOT resolvers, the later will never adopt IPv6.<br>
Of course, TLS fingerprinting can somewhat determine client software. But using ordinary web clients is what I’m thinking about.<br>
And I hope active probing will not be feasible for a league ‘B’ spying/censoring country with too many ‘strange’ connections to check.</p></td><td>2021-10-27T18:43:23.720Z</td></tr>
