There was a sudden, one-day drop in direct relay users (users not using a pluggable transport, just connecting to public Tor relays), and a simultaneous increase in obfs4 users. This is a commonly observed effect: direct Tor blocking causes people to enable pluggable transports.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html?start=2020-09-01&amp;end=2020-11-15&amp;country=by&amp;events=off\"><img src=\"possible-tor-block-in-belarus-in-october-2020/de76789972d2cb1ceb6604aa6385c77ba7615f68.png\" alt=\"userstats-relay-country-by-2020-09-01-2020-11-15-off\" data-base62-sha1=\"vJZOWa6JN2FfGN9B4iJ5Fb4KOik\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-combined.html?start=2020-09-01&amp;end=2020-11-15&amp;country=by\"><img src=\"possible-tor-block-in-belarus-in-october-2020/6a4972cce078ddd95c02e2d4b123de41577f9cae.png\" alt=\"userstats-bridge-combined-by-2020-09-01-2020-11-15\" data-base62-sha1=\"fafYpFYycW1PNIf1CETl4bn8e4K\" width=\"690\" height=\"431\"></a></p>",

This initial period of blocking was short-lived and connectivity to the Tor network was returned a few days later. Then, in October of 2020, Belarusian censors undertook a renewed effort to block access to Tor. This consisted of blocking access to Tor relays and directory authorities. Starting in February of 2021, we saw increasingly sophisticated enumeration and blocks of Tor’s bridges and bridge distribution infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In most places, censorship is not consistent across different ISPs or autonomous systems. We have data for the following ASes in Belarus, listed here along with their organization name (according to the latest whois data):</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Organization Name</th>\n<th>AS#</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Beltelecom</td>\n<td>6697</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Business Network</td>\n<td>12406</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mobile TeleSystems</td>\n<td>25106</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>COSMOS TV</td>\n<td>31143</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A1</td>\n<td>42772</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KT MAZ</td>\n<td>43232</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BeST</td>\n<td>44087</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flynet</td>\n<td>49711</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vash Internet</td>\n<td>50294</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GARANT</td>\n<td>50334</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Qline</td>\n<td>50438</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>United Networks</td>\n<td>50685</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unitary Services</td>\n<td>59861</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-3040-blocking-tor-relays-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3040-blocking-tor-relays-3\"></a>Blocking Tor relays</h2>\n<p>Our usage metrics data of directly connecting users to the Tor network is an early indicator that a region is blocking access to Tor.

report.</p>\n<p>Blocking the Tor directory authorities and the fallback directories will effectively prevent new users (or users with an expired guard) from downloading the Tor consensus, but so will the complete blocking of all Tor relays.</p>\n<p>We noticed an attempt to enumerate and block access to all Tor relays and kept their block list relatively up to date with the current consensus. A volunteer ran reachability scans of the entire Tor consensus from within the A1 ISP’s space on two different days, February 25th and March 3rd, to measure how agile the censor was at updating their Tor relays block list. Of the 6647 relays in the public Tor consensus on February 25th, 6647 of connection attempts to these relays from the A1 ISP in Belarus timed out with an error consistent with the blocking pattern described below. On March 3rd, 6966 out of 7064 relays in the consensus timed out.</p>\n<p>As expected, there was some churn as new relays joined the network and old relays dropped off. There were a total of 952 relays that were present in the March 3rd consensus but not present in the February 25th consensus. These relays may have been new, or they may have been existing relays that were just not online at the time of our first measurement on February 25th. Of these emergent relays, all but one timed out when a direction connection attempt was made.<br>\nThe reachability data of Tor relays suggests to us that the censor is automatically updating its block list based on the Tor consensus. Almost all of the relays that were not in the earlier consensus were blocked.</p>\n<p>We are omitting the packet captures from our volunteer for privacy reasons, but they did provide us some insight on the blocking mechanism used. Failed connections to blocked bridges and relays shared the following pattern:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">Tor user                  relay\n        ------- SYN -----&gt;\n        &lt;---- SYN ACK ----\n        ------- ACK -----&gt;\n        -- Client Hello -&gt;\n        -- Client Hello -&gt; (retransmission)\n        &lt;---- SYN ACK ---- (retransmission)\n        -- Client Hello -&gt; (retransmission)\n        &lt;---- SYN ACK ---- (retransmission)\n        ------- FIN -----&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>where it appears that the final ACK in the TCP handshake is being dropped, causing the client to eventually give up on the connection. This resulted in an SSL error in our logs which at first led us to believe the blocking was occurring at the TLS layer, but closer inspection shows us that the TCP handshake is never completed due to the missing final ACK packet.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-3040-blocking-tor-websites-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3040-blocking-tor-websites-4\"></a>Blocking Tor websites</h2>\n<p>According to OONI data from August 2020 to now, <a href=\"https://torproject.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://torproject.org</a> appears to have been reachable until more recently.

BridgeDB responds to user requests for bridges over three separate distribution channels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTPS by visiting <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://bridges.torproject.org</a>,</li>\n<li>email by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:bridges@torproject.org\">bridges@torproject.org</a>, and</li>\n<li>Moat by making a domain-fronted request to <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://bridges.torproject.org</a> within Tor Browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bridges in our database are partitioned such that any one bridge is only ever handed out over a single distribution channel.</p>\n<p>A volunteer performed reachability tests for a random selection of both vanilla and obfs4 bridges from each distribution channel throughout the months of February, March, and April. We found that only obfs4 bridges distributed by email were blocked. Access to bridges is limited by time and the requester’s email address, meaning that the bridges a user receives is determined by hashing the user’s email address with the current time interval (time intervals are defined at a granularity of 1 hour). To enumerate all of the bridges in this distribution channel, the censor would have had to repeatedly send requests for more bridges over the course of several hours, or possible from several email addresses.</p>\n<p>The enumeration of this channel appears thorough. We tested a total of thirteen email-distributed obfs4 bridges, and every bridge that went online before February 22nd was blocked. One of the bridges added on February 22nd was blocked, while the other was not, suggesting that the enumeration occurred some time in late February and then stopped.</p>\n<p><img src=\"possible-tor-block-in-belarus-in-october-2020/15e37b7304a6b299cae45cd197aa1e90f683cdab.png\" alt=\"Reachability of distributed obfs4 bridges\" data-base62-sha1=\"37Dp7XpO1rGpZ30qwVH7JCQRhEv\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></p>\n<p>None of the vanilla bridges we sent in any of the distribution channels were blocked during the duration of these experiments. By default, email requests to <a href=\"mailto:bridges@torproject.org\">bridges@torproject.org</a> return only obfs4 obfuscated bridges. A typical email request returns the following text:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">\n[This is an automated email.]\n\nHere are your bridges:\n\n  obfs4 [IP] [Fingerprint] [cert]\n  obfs4 [IP] [Fingerprint] [cert]\n\nAdd these bridges to your Tor Browser by opening your browser\npreferences, clicking on \"Tor\", and then adding them to the \"Provide a\nbridge\" field.\n\nIf these bridges are not what you need, reply to this email with one of\nthe following commands in the message body:\n\n  get bridges            (Request unobfuscated Tor bridges.)\n  get ipv6               (Request IPv6 bridges.)\n  get transport obfs4    (Request obfs4 obfuscated bridges.)\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>this default behaviour may be the reason behind the lack of enumeration for vanilla bridges.</p>\n<p>Since access to <a href=\"https://torproject.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://torproject.org</a> is currently blocked in Belarus, it is likely that our HTTPS distributor available at <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://bridges.torproject.org</a> is also blocked. This leaves only Moat bridges (accessible within Tor Browser) and private bridges as the only distribution methods available to users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-3040-no-evidence-of-dpi-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-3040-no-evidence-of-dpi-7\"></a>No Evidence of DPI</h2>\n<p>The reachability results and packet captures sent to us by our volunteer suggest that only endpoint IP-based blocking was used to block access to Tor bridges and relays.<br>\nThe blocking fingerprint for both bridges and relays shows all TCP connections to blocked relays being terminated before the end of the TCP handshake, before any fingerprintable TLS connection could occur, suggesting that the blocking rules are IP-based.</p>\n<p>We also suspect that censor is not using DPI to detect and block new Tor relays due to the fact that no vanilla bridges were blocked throughout the duration of our tests.</p>",
