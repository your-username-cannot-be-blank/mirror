The DTLS handshake completes and <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40407#note_3128583\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">several bytes of application data are received from the proxy</a>  before the client suddenly stops receiving data. This doesn’t rule out fingerprinting. There are a few proxies that do not appear to be blocked and Tor can be fully bootstrapped through these proxies, but we haven’t noticed any difference in the DTLS fingerprint between working proxies and proxies that go stale. It’s also possible that our vantage point tests aren’t offering an accurate view of why there is a drop in users.</p>\n<p>Related Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snowflake GitLab issue: <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40407\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Snowflake partially blocked in Russia 2024-11 (#40407) · Issues · The Tor Project / Anti-censorship / Pluggable Transports / Snowflake · GitLab</a></li>\n<li>Full analysis of previous DTLS fingerprinting: <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40014#note_2765061\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Make Snowflake's DTLS fingerprint more similar to popular WebRTC implementations (#40014) · Issues · The Tor Project / Anti-censorship / Pluggable Transports / Snowflake · GitLab</a></li>\n<li>net4people BBS issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/422\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Drop in Snowflake users from Russia and evidence of blocking starting 2024-11 · Issue #422 · net4people/bbs · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>",
