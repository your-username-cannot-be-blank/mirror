<p>At first we thought this was due to <a href="https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/309#issuecomment-2455673156" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">several recent certificate renewals of Fastly front domains</a> that were used for Snowflake, but we’ve since ruled out blocking of rendezvous channel. The timing of the drop in users also doesn’t quite match up with the domain renewals.</p>
<p>From our vantage point tests, it does not look like the <a href="https://ntc.party/t/ooni-reports-of-tor-blocking-in-certain-isps-since-2021-12-01/1477/19">DTLS fingerprinting of Snowflake that happened in Russia in 2021</a>. The DTLS handshake completes and <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/issues/40407#note_3128583" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">several bytes of application data are received from the proxy</a>  before the client suddenly stops receiving data. This doesn’t rule out fingerprinting. There are a few proxies that do not appear to be blocked and Tor can be fully bootstrapped through these proxies, but we haven’t noticed any difference in the DTLS fingerprint between working proxies and proxies that go stale. It’s also possible that our vantage point tests aren’t offering an accurate view of why there is a drop in users.</p>

<p>I suspect they sooner will block the broker (along all the CDNs), if you read the recent news.
