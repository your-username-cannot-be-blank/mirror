Probe-resistant proxy servers defeat <a href=\"https://ensa.fi/active-probing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">active probing</a> attacks by requiring the client to prove knowledge of a secret before revealing their proxy functionality. Most contemporary probe-resistant proxies, like <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/yawning/obfs4/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">obfs4</a> and <a href=\"https://shadowsocks.org/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Shadowsocks</a>, use a randomized protocol and respond to authentication failures by remaining silent, which is conceptually sound, but somewhat uncommon in the universe of protocols and <a href=\"/t/405\">tricky to do right</a>. HTTPT, in comparison, uses HTTPS as its carrier protocol, and responds to unauthenticated client requests not by remaining silent, but by replying the way a non-proxy-capable web server would. HTTPS offers a number of nice features for implementing a proxy: it is a common protocol with many diverse implementations; TLS itself is resistant to replay-based probing; TLS adds only a small amount of framing overhead; and it is possible to co-locate a proxy with exiting HTTPS services.</p>\n<p>An HTTPT client authenticates itself by requesting a secret URL path. This unguessable path is known only to legitimate clients and is the only means of accessing the web server’s hidden proxy functionality. Unauthenticated clients are therefore unable to probe it. The web server is configured to forward requests for the secret path as if it were <a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">forwarding a WebSocket connection</a>, transforming the HTTPS connection into a two-way TLS-protected stream between the client and the HTTPT proxy backend. This WebSocket trick enables broad compatibility for HTTPT, as all major web servers have the ability to do WebSocket forwarding, without a custom plugin. (The paper tests with Apache, Nginx, and Caddy.) Once forwarded, the remainder of the connection does not even have to conform to the WebSocket protocol, which means there is no overhead beyond what is added by TLS.</p>\n<p>The ideal situation for HTTPT deployment is to install a proxy on an established HTTPS web site. Unauthenticated active probers will only find whatever the web site normally serves, while authenticated clients who know the secret path can access the proxy. An established web site already has a reasonable TLS fingerprint and a valid certificate. (The client still has to take care about its TLS fingerprint, using <a href=\"https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">uTLS</a> or something similar.) A deployment not connected to any existing web server is also possible, but requires some thought towards what to return on an authentication failure. Section 3.2 of the paper covers some options, which include returning an error page or transparently proxying some other web site are all possibilities. According to a <a href=\"https://censys.io/ipv4/report?field=443.https.get.status_line.raw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Censys survey</a>, returning an error page is not unusual: about half of actual HTTPS servers respond with a 4xx or 5xx status code when probed.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the authors for reviewing a draft of this summary.</p>",
