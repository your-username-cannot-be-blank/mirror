    <tr><td>vanyaindigo</td><td><p>A detailed new report says that a long-time bug in iOS prevents any VPN from fully encrypting all traffic — and also claims that Apple has known about it and chosen to do nothing since discovery in 2020. The vulnerability was first discovered by VPN firm ProtonVPN in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/26/ios-bug-prevents-vpn-apps-from-encrypting-all-traffic" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">March 2020</a>. At the time, the company said that when a VPN is switched on, the OS should terminate all internet connections and automatically re-establish them via the VPN to prevent unencrypted data leakage.</p>

The author assumes that when gateway-redirection VPN is connected, all the traffic should only be forwarded via VPN. This is not the case basically on every OS.</p></td><td>2022-08-26T07:46:48.517Z</td></tr>
