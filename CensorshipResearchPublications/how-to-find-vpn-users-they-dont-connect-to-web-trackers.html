    <tr><td>tango</td><td><p>On the MASQUE list, Töma Gavrichenkov, claiming some inside knowledge, suggests a way to detect VPN users. They are the ones that have long-lived high-traffic connections, but never connect directly to web trackers (Google Analytics etc.). The idea is that because web tracking is so ubiquitous, non-VPN users are constantly connecting to tracking hosts, but VPN users who have all their connections tunnelled do not.</p>

<p>Basically their product works as follows.  First, it has a collection of IP addresses and some behavioral patterns of an order of hundreds to thousands of typical external resources Web sites use: CDNs, trackers (Google Analytics, Newrelic, JQuery, Recaptcha, to name a few, but there are more), etc.  The list is meant to be being updated once in a few days if not hours.</p>
<p>Then, if a client establishes a number of active bandwidth-heavy connections to remote servers but doesn’t connect to a statistically significant number of those trackers within some timeframe (the thresholds are also being regularly updated I think), then it assumed to be using a VPN.  All the established sessions (no matter if it’s TCP or UDP) are dropped and the former endpoints (except some) are greylisted and reported, and the subsequent HTTP[S] connection establishment attempts get a redirect to a Web page which tells the user to switch off the VPN connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting idea. The subsequent discussion on the list seems a little overblown, though. I think I agree with <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/masque/ZaNXbq4anEFjyvVsCdzcNFbLC6Y">Ted Hardie</a> and <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/masque/nHUWJ1MV-erhShd8XTToYyk8LzA">Ben Schwartz</a> that there’s nothing fundamental about this traffic analysis attack that’s different from other traffic analysis attacks, and no reason to freak out about this one in particular.</p>
<p>No one mentioned it on the list, but it seems to me that you could defeat this kind of attack anyway, by running a non-tunnelled web browser alongside your VPN? Let it refresh itself, just to ensure that some threshold of trackers are being contacted while you’re using the VPN.</p></td><td>2019-12-12T18:55:40.457Z</td></tr><tr><td>ValdikSS</td><td><aside class="quote no-group" data-username="tango" data-post="1" data-topic="269">

<p>At least the message tells us that such systems are being developed and used, and we should expect them in a VPN-blocking countries like Turkmenistan sooner or later.</p></td><td>2019-12-13T03:43:22.256Z</td></tr>
