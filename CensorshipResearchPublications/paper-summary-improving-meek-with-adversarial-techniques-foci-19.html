<p>Improving Meek With Adversarial Techniques<br>

<p>This paper is concerned with <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek" rel="nofollow noopener">meek</a>’s susceptibility to classification based on traffic flow analysis; i.e., packet sizes and packet timing. The authors collect their own traffic traces of browsing home pages with and without meek-with-Tor. They identify feature differences and demonstrate three classifiers that can distinguish ordinary HTTPS from meek HTTPS. They then show how minimal perturbation of the meek-derived feature vectors can hinder the classifiers.</p>
<p>To build a corpus of training and test data, they built a parallel data collection framework using Docker containers and a centralized work queue. They browsed 10,000 home pages both with a headless Firefox, and with Tor Browser configured to use its meek-azure bridge. They performed the test from three different networks—residential, university, and datacenter—yielding a total of 60,000 traffic traces. From these, they extract binned features: TCP payload length, and interarrival times tagged with direction (upstream or downstream). Their packet length distribution differs from <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/#sec:trafficanalysis-datalen" rel="nofollow noopener">the one reported in the 2015 domain fronting paper</a>; the authors speculate that could be because of differences in source data, or changes to meek that have happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>They then use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" rel="nofollow noopener">GAN (generative adversarial network)</a>, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/yunjey/StarGAN" rel="nofollow noopener">StarGAN</a> implementation, to iteratively transform a meek feature vector so that it looks more like a ordinary HTTPS feature vector. The transformation process tries to minimize the size of changes required, by including a perturbation loss term that increases as more changes are required. Minimizing perturbation is to make it easier to implement the resulting distribution, while still fooling the classifiers.</p>
