<p><a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls">ShadowTLS</a> is a circumvention proxy with a good trick for imitating a TLS connection: it forwards the first part of a connection, the TLS handshake, to an actual TLS server. After the handshake, the ShadowTLS relay starts forwarding traffic to a separate proxy server, for example Shadowsocks. (Similar to the idea of <a href="https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/18#issuecomment-561336149">mask sites</a> in Conjure.) This paper discusses flaws in <a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls/blob/dee3a5a819d6f56cfdd56c44a0d42be186c44238/docs/protocol-en.md#v1">V1 of the ShadowTLS protocol</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls/blob/dee3a5a819d6f56cfdd56c44a0d42be186c44238/docs/protocol-zh.md#v1">中文</a>) that made it vulnerable to passive and active distinguishing attacks.</p>
<p>Two attacks require only passive observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ShadowTLS client has a <a href="https://tlsfingerprint.io/id/ebaa863800590426">distinctive and uncommon TLS fingerprint</a>. (The server-side fingerprint is, of course, not a problem, because it comes from a genuine TLS server.)</li>
<li>The traffic after the TLS handshake does not look like TLS—it’s just raw Shadowsocks, or whatever the chosen proxy protocol is. In particular, traffic past the handshake does not have <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246#section-10"><code>application_data</code> record framing</a>. (This property also leads to one of the active attacks.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Three other attacks involve seeing how the server responds to bad data at different stages: before the handshake, after the handshake, and inside an <code>application_data</code> record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a plaintext HTTP request at the beginning of the connection. Most TLS servers will terminate the TCP connection with a RST, or send back an HTTP error response; but the ShadowTLS relay closes the connection with a FIN/ACK.</li>
<li>Send random data after the TLS handshake. A real TLS server will raise an error or close the connection; but the ShadowTLS relay has already started forwarding traffic to the proxy at this point, so there are no further TLS error checks.</li>
<li>Send a well-formed <code>application_data</code> record after the handshake, but corrupt the record so that the integrity check fails. TLS <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246#section-6.2.3.3">is specific</a> about what should happen in this situation: the server should send a <code>bad_record_mac</code> alert. The ShadowTLS relay does not, because no TLS server is involved by that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors do a ZMap scan and find about 15,000 TLS servers (0.05% of all TLS servers) that respond to the three active probes in the same way a ShadowTLS server would. While other evidence suggests that many of those 15,000 are not actually ShadowTLS relays, the small proportion means a censor could block this subset of TLS servers with little risk.</p>
<p>The paper then offers solutions against the distinguishers. For TLS handshake fingerprinting, they recommend adopting <a href="https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls">uTLS</a> in the client. For the distinguishers that rely on non-TLS data, they recommend changing the post-handshake traffic to wrap data in <code>application_data</code> records, and then only forwarding records that are encrypted with a special key to the proxy; all other records go to the real TLS server. <a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls/blob/dee3a5a819d6f56cfdd56c44a0d42be186c44238/docs/protocol-en.md#v2">V2 of the protocol</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls/blob/dee3a5a819d6f56cfdd56c44a0d42be186c44238/docs/protocol-zh.md#v2">中文</a>), which began to be implemented in ShadowTLS <a href="https://github.com/ihciah/shadow-tls/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a>, adopts a slightly different strategy: the client inserts a MAC using a shared secret at the beginning of one of its <code>application_data</code> records, and only after that does the ShadowTLS relay begin forwarding traffic to the proxy server.</p></td><td>2024-01-03T16:50:15.672Z</td></tr>
